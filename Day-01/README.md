- Originally called "Mocha", then "LiveScript", finally "JavaScript".
- Designed to make web pages interactive.
  
*1997 - ECMAScript Standard:*

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, Cross-Platform, Light-Weight, Interpreted, and Multi-Paradigm language.  

## What is the purpose of JavaScript?

JavaScript makes the web pages dynamic, and interactive. It's one of the three core technologies of web development alongside HTML and CSS.

### The Web Development Trinity

- HTML : The Structure of the Web page.
- CSS : Styling HTML document
- JavaScript : Provides interactivity for Web pages.
  
## Features of JavaScript

- Dynamically typed language
- Interpreted language
- Proto type based language
- First-Class functions
- Event driven
- Automatic Memory management
  
## Host Environment

JavaScript code can run in 2 different host environments.

- Browser
- Node.js

## Browser Vs Node.js

*Browser Environment:*
JavaScript runs in web browsers using the browser's JavaScript engine:

- **Chrome**: V8 Engine
- **Firefox**: SpiderMonkey
- **Safari**: JavaScriptCore
- **Edge**: V8 Engine
  
*Node.js Environment:*
Node.js is a runtime that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, built on Chrome's V8 engine.

## Use cases and Applications

- Frontend Development
- Backend Development
- MERN / MEAN stack
- Mobile Development
  
### Development Environment

- VS Code
- Atom
  
## Including JavaScript in HTML

- Inline
  - Without JavaScript: Static button ```<button>Click me</button>```
  - With JavaScript: Interactive button ```<button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click me</button>```
- Internal : using ```<script></script>```
- External : using ```<script src="filename"></script>```
  
### Best Practices for including JavaScript

- **Place scripts before closing `</body>` tag** for better page load performance
- **Use external files** for reusable code
- **Minimize inline JavaScript** for better maintainability
  
## Print statement

```console.log("Hello World!")```
```console.log(10)```
  
## Alert statement

```alert("Hey, what are you waiting for? Let's learn JavaScript...")```
